import GqExample from '/src/components/GqExample.astro';
import {Code} from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

import inputQuery from '/src/examples/introduction/introduction-query.gq?raw';
import outputJson from '/src/examples/introduction/introduction-output.json?raw';

## Main goal

Among the rise of Rust as a fast and reliable programming language, countless projects have born to
improve the performance and the overall experience of users and developers. Is in this context where
GQ comes to life, a filtering tool that aims to provide the **fastest** processing times along with a significant
improvement in the **simplicity** of its underlying query language.

## Query language

Based on [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/), we wanted to extend the capabilities of an already powerful
QL outside the realm of API development, remodeling it from the ground up to be more suitable for
JSON filtering and accessing. let's take a look at a simple example:

<Code code={inputJson} lang="json" title="output.json" />
<GqExample codes={[inputQuery, outputJson]} langs={['json', 'json']} titles={['query.gq', 'output.json']} />

As you can see, the query language has some similarities with GraphQL, including a JSON-like syntax, the argument definition or the
field aliasing. However, it adds more funtionalites like the **dot operator** to access nested fields or the **extended comparison operators** to filter
array elements.

You can learn more about all the language capabilities in the [Concepts Section](/concepts/fields).
