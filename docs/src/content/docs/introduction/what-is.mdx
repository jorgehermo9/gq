import GqExample from '/src/components/GqExample.astro';
import {Code} from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import inputJson from '/src/content/examples/products/simple-product.json?raw';
import inputQuery from '/src/content/examples/products/simple-query.gq?raw';
import outputJson from '/src/content/examples/products/simple-output.json?raw';

## Main goal

Among the rise of Rust as a fast and reliable programming language, countless projects have born to
improve the performance and the overall experience of users and developers. Is in this context where
GQ comes to life, a filtering tool that aims to provide the **fastest** processing times along with a significant
improvement in the **simplicity** of its underlying query language.

## Query language

Based on [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/), we wanted to extend the capabilities of an already powerful
QL outside the realm of API development. 

<GqExample codes={[inputJson, inputQuery]} langs={['json', 'json']} titles={['input.json', 'input.gq']} />
<Code code={outputJson} lang="json" title="output.json" />
