### Using cargo

The `gq` binary is available through `cargo` and can be installed with the following command:

```sh
cargo install gq-cli
```

:::note
If you don't have `cargo` installed, you can check how to install the Rust toolchain [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

### Compiling from source

You can also compile `gq` from source by cloning the repository and building it with `cargo`:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jorgehermo9/gq
cd gq
cargo build --release
./target/release/gq --help
```

### From AUR package

If you are using an Arch-based distribution, you can download the `gq` package directly from the AUR:

```sh
yay -S gq
```
